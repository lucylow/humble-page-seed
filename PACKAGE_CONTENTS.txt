## üöÄ QUICK START

### Option 1: Use Improved Files (Recommended)
1. Extract the zip file
2. Navigate to retinascan-backend/retinascan-backend/
3. Replace original files with improved versions:
   ```bash
   mv utils/model_manager_improved.py utils/model_manager.py
   mv utils/image_processor_improved.py utils/image_processor.py
   mv services/prediction_service_improved.py services/prediction_service.py
   mv config_improved.py config.py
   mv train_model_improved.py train_model.py
   mv requirements_improved.txt requirements.txt
   ```
4. Update main.py (see INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run: `python main.py`

### Option 2: Keep Both Versions
1. Keep improved files with "_improved" suffix
2. Use feature flags to switch between versions
3. See INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md for details
