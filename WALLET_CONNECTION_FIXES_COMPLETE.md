# DomaLand.AI Wallet Connection Fixes - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
All wallet connection issues have been successfully resolved with comprehensive improvements to error handling, user feedback, wallet detection, and connection flow.

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Problem**: Generic error messages with no user guidance
- **Solution**: Added specific error codes and user-friendly messages:
  - `4001`: Connection rejected by user
  - `-32002`: Connection request already pending
  - `-32003`: Wallet is locked
  - `4900`: Wallet not connected to network
  - `4901`: User rejected request
  - `4902`: Network not found

### 2. Improved Wallet Detection
- **Problem**: Only detected MetaMask specifically
- **Solution**: Added support for multiple wallet types:
  - MetaMask 🦊
  - Coinbase Wallet 🔵
  - Brave Wallet 🦁
  - Rabby 🐰
  - Trust Wallet 🔒
  - Frame 🖼️
  - Opera Wallet 🎭

### 3. Enhanced User Feedback
- **Problem**: No loading states or visual feedback
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive UI feedback:
  - Loading spinners during connection
  - Clear error messages with dismiss buttons
  - Success indicators
  - Connection status badges

### 4. Better Chain Switching
- **Problem**: Poor error handling for chain switching
- **Solution**: Enhanced chain switching with:
  - Automatic network addition if not present
  - Better error messages for user rejections
  - Graceful handling of pending requests

### 5. Fixed Event Listeners
- **Problem**: Memory leaks from improper cleanup
- **Solution**: 
  - Proper event listener cleanup with mounted flag
  - Prevented infinite loops in useEffect
  - Better state management

### 6. Development Mode Support
- **Problem**: No fallback for testing without wallet
- **Solution**: Added mock wallet mode for development with:
  - Environment check (development only)
  - Mock account and chain data
  - Clear development indicators
