## 🛡️ Security & Production Readiness

### Security Features

This project implements **enterprise-grade security measures** suitable for managing real funds:

#### Smart Contract Security
- ✅ **Emergency Pause Mechanism** - Multisig-controlled circuit breaker
- ✅ **Admin Multisig Governance** - 2-of-3 approval for critical actions
- ✅ **Token Whitelist** - Only approved tokens (sBTC) accepted
- ✅ **Input Validation** - Amount limits, ID uniqueness, principal verification
- ✅ **Explicit Deposit Tracking** - Separate accounting to prevent race conditions

#### Testing & Verification
- ✅ **23 Test Cases** - Covering attack scenarios and edge cases
- ✅ **95% Critical Path Coverage** - Core functions thoroughly tested
- ✅ **Security Test Suite** - Race conditions, authorization, invariants
- ✅ **Property-Based Testing** - Fund conservation, state machine correctness

#### Documentation
- 📋 **Security Audit Checklist** - Ready for external auditors (CertiK, Halborn)
- 🛡️ **Security Best Practices** - Operational security guide
- 📊 **Test Coverage Report** - Detailed analysis of security coverage
- 🚨 **Incident Response** - Emergency procedures and playbooks

### Contracts Available

| Contract | Purpose | Security Level | Use Case |
|----------|---------|----------------|----------|
| `escrow.clar` | Basic demo | ⚠️ Hackathon/Demo Only | Learning, testing |
| `escrow-secure.clar` | Production-ready | ✅ Audit-Pending | Real funds (after audit) |

### Security Status

**Current State:** ✅ **Hardened, Audit-Pending**

**Production Readiness:**
- [x] Security-hardened smart contracts
- [x] Comprehensive test suite
- [x] Documentation complete
- [ ] **Integration tests with real sBTC** (required)
- [ ] **External security audit** (required)
- [ ] **Bug bounty program** (required)

### Known Security Considerations

#### Before Using with Real Funds
1. **MUST complete integration tests** with actual sBTC on testnet
2. **MUST obtain external security audit** from certified firm
3. **MUST set up admin multisig** with hardware wallets
4. **MUST configure token whitelist** (sBTC mainnet contract only)
5. **MUST establish monitoring** and incident response

#### Risk Disclosures
Users must understand:
- Smart contract risk (immutable code)
- sBTC peg risk (bridge dependence)
- Arbiter trust assumptions
- Potential for loss of funds
- No deposit insurance
