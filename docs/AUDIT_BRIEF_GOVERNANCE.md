# 🔍 Audit Brief: Smart Invoice Escrow with Governance

## Executive Summary for Auditors

**Project:** BitMind Smart Invoice System  
**Version:** 2.0 (Governance-Enhanced)  
**Audit Priority:** CRITICAL - Handles real BTC value via sBTC  
**Estimated Audit Time:** 40-60 hours

---

## 📋 Scope

### Contracts to Audit

| Contract | Lines | Priority | Focus Areas |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| `governance-multisig.clar` | ~200 | 🔴 CRITICAL | Multisig logic, threshold, re-execution |
| `escrow-governance.clar` | ~300 | 🔴 CRITICAL | Fund safety, authorization, integration |
| `mock-token.clar` | ~100 | 🟡 MEDIUM | SIP-010 compliance (test only) |

**Total Smart Contract Code:** ~600 lines  
**Test Code:** ~1,000 lines (27 test cases)

### Out of Scope
- Frontend JavaScript/TypeScript code
- AI parsing service
- Third-party contracts (sBTC, Stacks core)

## 🎯 Critical Invariants to Verify

### INV-1: Fund Conservation (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Statement:** 
```
At all times: 
  escrow_balance = sum(deposited_amounts) for all FUNDED invoices
  OR
  No tokens can leave escrow except via release-funds or refund
```

**Why Critical:** Prevents fund theft

**Test:** Check all token transfer paths, verify accounting

**Files:**
- `escrow-governance.clar:release-funds`
- `escrow-governance.clar:refund`
- `escrow-governance.clar:deposit-funds`

### INV-2: Authorization Integrity
**Statement:**
```
Only (payer OR arbiter) can release-funds for invoice X
AND
Only (admin OR governance-principal) can pause/whitelist/set-admin
```

**Why Critical:** Prevents unauthorized access

**Test:** Attempt releases/admin actions from unauthorized principals

**Files:**
- `escrow-governance.clar:release-funds` (lines ~260-280)
- `escrow-governance.clar:governance-apply` (lines ~100-120)
- `escrow-governance.clar:is-admin-caller`

### INV-3: Governance Threshold Enforcement
**Statement:**
```
Proposal can only execute if:
  confirm_count >= threshold
  AND executed == false
```

**Why Critical:** Prevents single-key governance bypass

**Test:** Execute with insufficient confirmations

**Files:**
- `governance-multisig.clar:execute` (lines ~120-150)
- `governance-multisig.clar:confirm`

### INV-4: Single Execution Per Proposal
**Statement:**
```
Once proposal is executed:
  executed flag = true
  Cannot execute again
```

**Why Critical:** Prevents double-actions (double-pause, etc.)

**Test:** Execute same proposal twice

**Files:**
- `governance-multisig.clar:execute` (line ~130)

### INV-5: Token Whitelist Enforcement
**Statement:**
```
create-invoice only succeeds if:
  token-contract is in whitelist
  AND approved == true
```

**Why Critical:** Prevents malicious token contracts

**Test:** Create invoice with non-whitelisted token

**Files:**
- `escrow-governance.clar:check-token-whitelisted`
- `escrow-governance.clar:create-invoice`

---

## 🚨 High-Risk Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Governance Bypass via Re-execution

**Attack:**
```clarity
;; Attacker: Execute pause proposal multiple times
1. Proposal created: pause (id=1)
2. Threshold reached, executed once
3. Attacker: execute(1) again → should FAIL
```

**Expected Defense:**
- `executed` flag check prevents re-execution
- Error `ERR-ALREADY-EXECUTED` returned

**Test:** `governance_security_test.ts:SECURITY: Cannot execute proposal twice`

**Audit Check:**
- [ ] Verify `executed` flag set BEFORE action execution
- [ ] Check no TOCTOU race condition
- [ ] Validate flag cannot be reset

### Scenario 2: Unauthorized Fund Release

**Attack:**
```clarity
;; Attacker: Release invoice funds as non-payer/non-arbiter
(contract-call? .escrow-governance release-funds u1)
```

**Expected Defense:**
- Authorization check: `(or (is-eq tx-sender payer) (is-eq tx-sender arbiter))`
- Error `ERR-NOT-ARBITER-OR-PAYER` returned

**Test:** `escrow_security_test.ts:SECURITY: Unauthorized release attempt`

**Audit Check:**
- [ ] Verify authorization before token transfer
- [ ] Check no bypass via governance-apply
- [ ] Validate arbiter cannot be set to attacker post-creation

### Scenario 3: Governance Takeover via Malicious Proposal

**Attack:**
```clarity
;; Attacker: Compromise 1 key, propose malicious set-admin
1. Attacker proposes set-admin to attacker address
2. Needs threshold-1 more confirmations
3. Social engineering / wait for compromise
```

**Expected Defense:**
- Requires threshold confirmations
- All proposals visible on-chain
- Off-chain monitoring alerts

**Mitigation:**
- Monitoring dashboard
- Automated alerts on proposals
- Owner communication protocol

**Audit Check:**
- [ ] Verify threshold cannot be changed mid-proposal
- [ ] Check proposal creator cannot auto-confirm
- [ ] Validate owner list immutable (or requires own proposal)

### Scenario 4: Token Contract Reentrancy

**Attack:**
```clarity
;; Malicious token contract:
;; On transfer, callback to escrow to release again
(define-public (transfer ...)
  (contract-call? .escrow-governance release-funds u1)
  (ok true))
```

**Expected Defense:**
- Clarity prevents reentrancy by design
- State updated before external call
- Token whitelist prevents malicious tokens

**Test:** Use mock token (safe), integration test with real sBTC

**Audit Check:**
- [ ] Verify Clarity no-reentrancy guarantee applies
- [ ] Check state updates before `contract-call?`
- [ ] Validate whitelist enforcement

## 🔍 Code Review Checklist

### Governance Multisig (`governance-multisig.clar`)

**Initialization:**
- [ ] `init-owners` can only be called once
- [ ] `init-owners` requires deployer/contract-owner
- [ ] Owner list cannot exceed 10 (list limit)
- [ ] Threshold >= 1 and <= owner count

**Proposal Lifecycle:**
- [ ] `propose` requires caller is owner
- [ ] Proposal IDs are unique (map-insert pattern)
- [ ] `confirm` prevents double-confirmation
- [ ] `confirm` increments count atomically
- [ ] `execute` checks threshold before action
- [ ] `execute` sets executed flag
- [ ] Action codes validated (u1-u4)

**Contract Calls:**
- [ ] `contract-call?` to escrow checked for errors
- [ ] Escrow principal validated before call
- [ ] Arguments passed correctly to governance-apply

### Escrow Governance (`escrow-governance.clar`)

**Admin Control:**
- [ ] `set-governance` only callable by admin
- [ ] `governance-apply` only callable by governance
- [ ] `is-admin-caller` checks both admin AND governance
- [ ] Direct admin functions still work (pause/unpause)

**Invoice Lifecycle:**
- [ ] `create-invoice` checks pause state
- [ ] `create-invoice` checks token whitelist
- [ ] `create-invoice` validates amount bounds
- [ ] `deposit-funds` verifies actual balance
- [ ] `release-funds` checks authorization
- [ ] `release-funds` verifies FUNDED status
- [ ] Token transfer uses `as-contract` pattern

**Token Integration:**
- [ ] `contract-call?` to token checked for errors
- [ ] Token contract from invoice data (not arg)
- [ ] Balance check before marking FUNDED
- [ ] Transfer amount matches deposited-amount
