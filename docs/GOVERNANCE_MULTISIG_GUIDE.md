## 🎯 Overview

This guide explains the complete multisig governance system that provides decentralized control over the Smart Invoice escrow contract.

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Governance Multisig Contract       │
│  - 3+ Owners                        │
│  - Threshold (e.g., 2-of-3)         │
│  - Propose → Confirm → Execute      │
└───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                │ governance-apply()
                ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Escrow Contract                    │
│  - Accepts governance-principal     │

## 📋 Contracts

### 1. `governance-multisig.clar`

**Purpose:** Multisig controller for admin operations

**Key Features:**
- Owner list with configurable threshold
- Proposal system (propose → confirm → execute)
- Supported actions: pause, unpause, whitelist-token, set-admin
- Confirmation tracking per proposal
- One-time execution per proposal

**Functions:**
```clarity
;; Setup
(init-owners (list principals) threshold)
(set-escrow escrow-principal)

;; Governance flow
(propose action arg1 arg2)           ;; Create proposal
(confirm proposal-id)                ;; Confirm by owner
(execute proposal-id)                ;; Execute when threshold reached

;; Read-only
(get-proposal proposal-id)
(has-confirmed proposal-id owner)
(get-confirmation-count proposal-id)
```

**Action Codes:**
- `u1` = Pause escrow
- `u2` = Unpause escrow
- `u3` = Whitelist token (arg1=token, arg2=1 for approve)
- `u4` = Set admin (arg1=new admin principal)

### 2. `escrow-governance.clar`

**Purpose:** Escrow contract with governance support

**Key Features:**
- Accepts calls from both admin AND governance-principal
- `governance-apply()` function for governance execution
- Direct admin functions still available (emergency use)
- All security features from escrow-secure.clar

**Governance Integration:**
```clarity
;; Set governance contract (one-time, admin only)
(set-governance governance-principal)

;; Called by governance after threshold reached
(governance-apply action arg1 arg2)

;; Check if caller is authorized
(is-admin-caller caller)  ;; Returns true for admin OR governance
```

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Deploy Contracts

```bash
# 1. Deploy mock token (testnet only)
clarinet deploy mock-token

# 2. Deploy escrow contract
clarinet deploy escrow-governance

# 3. Deploy governance multisig
clarinet deploy governance-multisig
```

### Step 2: Initialize Governance

```clarity
;; Set up 3 owners with 2-of-3 threshold
(contract-call? .governance-multisig init-owners 
  (list 'SP2OWNER1... 'SP2OWNER2... 'SP2OWNER3...)
  u2)

;; Point governance at escrow
(contract-call? .governance-multisig set-escrow 
  'ST1DEPLOYER...escrow-governance)

;; Point escrow at governance
(contract-call? .escrow-governance set-governance 
  'ST1DEPLOYER...governance-multisig)
```

### Step 3: Whitelist Production Token

```clarity
;; Propose whitelist sBTC
(contract-call? .governance-multisig propose
  u3  ;; action: whitelist-token
  'SP3DX3H4FEYZJZ586MFBS25ZW3HZDMEW92260R2PR.sbtc-token
  u1) ;; approved=true

;; Confirm by owner 2
(contract-call? .governance-multisig confirm u1)

;; Execute (automatically calls escrow)
(contract-call? .governance-multisig execute u1)
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### Multisig Protection

**Problem:** Single admin = single point of failure  
**Solution:** N-of-M multisig for critical operations

**Benefits:**
- No single key can pause/unpause
- No single key can modify whitelist
- Compromised key cannot cause damage alone
- Transparent governance (all proposals on-chain)

### Separation of Concerns

**Governance Contract:**
- Manages proposal lifecycle
- Tracks confirmations
- Enforces threshold
- Calls escrow when approved

**Escrow Contract:**
- Validates governance-principal caller
- Executes approved actions
- Maintains security invariants
- Emergency direct admin still available

### Audit Trail

All governance actions are logged on-chain:
```clarity
{event: "proposal-created", id: u1, action: u1, creator: 'SP...'}
{event: "proposal-confirmed", id: u1, by: 'SP...'}
{event: "proposal-executed", id: u1, action: u1}
{event: "contract-paused", by: "governance"}
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Emergency Pause

**Scenario:** Potential exploit discovered

```clarity
;; Owner 1 proposes pause
(contract-call? .governance-multisig propose u1 'SP000... u0)
;; Returns: (ok u1)  ;; proposal ID

;; Owner 2 confirms (reaches threshold)
(contract-call? .governance-multisig confirm u1)

;; Anyone can execute now
(contract-call? .governance-multisig execute u1)

;; Contract is now paused - verify
(contract-call? .escrow-governance is-paused)
;; Returns: (ok true)
```

### Example 2: Add New Token to Whitelist

**Scenario:** Adding new token contract

```clarity
;; Owner 1 proposes whitelist
(contract-call? .governance-multisig propose
  u3  ;; whitelist-token action
  'SP1234...new-token
  u1) ;; approved=true
;; Returns: (ok u2)

;; Owner 2 confirms
(contract-call? .governance-multisig confirm u2)

;; Owner 3 confirms (extra confirmation, threshold=2)
(contract-call? .governance-multisig confirm u2)

;; Execute
(contract-call? .governance-multisig execute u2)

;; Verify whitelisted
(contract-call? .escrow-governance is-token-whitelisted 'SP1234...new-token)
;; Returns: (ok true)
```

### Example 3: Transfer Admin Rights

**Scenario:** Rotating admin to new multisig

```clarity
;; Propose new admin
(contract-call? .governance-multisig propose
  u4  ;; set-admin action
  'SP9999...new-admin
  u0) ;; unused arg
;; Returns: (ok u3)

;; Confirm by threshold owners
(contract-call? .governance-multisig confirm u3)  ;; owner 1
(contract-call? .governance-multisig confirm u3)  ;; owner 2

;; Execute
(contract-call? .governance-multisig execute u3)

;; Verify new admin
(contract-call? .escrow-governance get-admin)
;; Returns: (ok 'SP9999...new-admin)
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run governance security tests
clarinet test tests/governance_security_test.ts

# Expected output:
# ✓ GOVERNANCE: Complete multisig workflow
# ✓ GOVERNANCE: Pause via multisig
# ✓ GOVERNANCE: Unpause restores functionality
# ✓ SECURITY: Unauthorized user cannot propose
# ✓ SECURITY: Cannot execute without threshold
# ✓ SECURITY: Cannot execute proposal twice
# ✓ INTEGRATION: Full invoice flow
```

### Test Coverage

**Governance Tests (7 tests):**
- ✅ Whitelist token via multisig
- ✅ Pause via multisig
- ✅ Unpause via multisig
- ✅ Unauthorized proposal attempt
- ✅ Insufficient confirmations
- ✅ Double execution prevention
- ✅ Full invoice flow integration

**Security Tests (from escrow_security_test.ts - 20 tests):**

## 📊 Comparison: Before vs After

| Feature | Before (Single Admin) | After (Multisig) |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Pause Control** | 1 admin key | 2-of-3 multisig |
| **Whitelist Control** | 1 admin key | 2-of-3 multisig |
| **Key Compromise Risk** | 🔴 Critical | 🟢 Mitigated |
| **Transparency** | ⚠️ Off-chain | ✅ On-chain |
| **Audit Trail** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Complete |
| **Emergency Response** | Admin-only | Admin OR multisig |
| **Decentralization** | ❌ Centralized | ✅ Decentralized |

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### 1. Emergency Direct Admin Access

**Why it exists:**
- Faster response than multisig proposal process
- For time-critical security incidents
- Requires same security as before (hardware wallet)

**When to use:**
- Only in true emergencies (active exploit)
- Document every use
- Transition to multisig control ASAP

### 2. Owner Key Management

**Best Practices:**
- Use hardware wallets (Ledger/Trezor)
- Geographic distribution of keys
- Secure backup procedures
- Regular key rotation (annually)
- Document key holders
- Clear succession plan

### 3. Threshold Selection

**Recommendations:**
| # Owners | Threshold | Use Case |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| 3 | 2 | Standard (recommended) |
| 5 | 3 | High security |
| 7 | 4 | DAO governance |

**Formula:** Threshold = (Owners / 2) + 1

### 4. Proposal Best Practices

**Before proposing:**
- Discuss with other owners off-chain
- Document rationale
- Test on testnet first
- Announce to community (if public)

**Proposal naming:**
- Use consistent proposal IDs
- Document action codes
- Keep off-chain records

## 🔧 Advanced Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Owner Compromise

**Detection:**
- Unauthorized proposals
- Suspicious confirmations
- Owner reports compromise

**Response:**
1. Other owners refuse to confirm suspicious proposals
2. Create proposal to remove compromised owner (extend governance contract)
3. Execute after threshold confirmation
4. Rotate to new key

### Scenario 2: Lost Owner Key

**Impact:**
- Reduces effective owner count
- May prevent reaching threshold

**Solutions:**
- Design threshold to tolerate 1 lost key (e.g., 2-of-3)
- Have backup owners ready
- Document recovery procedures

### Scenario 3: Upgrade Governance

**Process:**
1. Deploy new governance contract (v2)
2. Propose `set-governance` with new principal
3. Confirm and execute via current governance
4. Verify new governance works
5. Retire old governance
