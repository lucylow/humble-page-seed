## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Clarinet (for smart contracts)
- Wallet (Hiro Wallet recommended)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Already included in main project
npm install
```

The following packages are already configured:
- `@radix-ui/react-select` - Select dropdowns
- `lucide-react` - Icons
- `recharts` - Charts (if needed)

### Step 2: Smart Contract Deployment

```bash
cd contracts

# Test contracts
clarinet test

# Deploy to testnet
clarinet deployments generate --testnet
clarinet deployments apply -p deployments/default.testnet-plan.yaml
```

### Step 3: Configure Contract Addresses

Update `src/lib/stacksIntegration.ts` with deployed contract addresses:

```typescript
export const CONTRACTS = {
  invoiceNFTMarketplace: 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.invoice-nft-marketplace',
  paymentRouter: 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.payment-router',
  yieldEscrow: 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.yield-escrow',
  multisigGovernance: 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.multisig-governance-advanced'
};
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to:
- http://localhost:5173/nft-marketplace
- http://localhost:5173/analytics
- http://localhost:5173/yield-optimizer
- http://localhost:5173/cross-chain-swap
- http://localhost:5173/treasury
