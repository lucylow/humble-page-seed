## 🎯 Critical Security Invariants

These invariants MUST hold at all times:

### INV-1: Fund Conservation
**Statement:** `Total deposited funds == Sum of all FUNDED invoice amounts`
- **Test:** `tests/escrow_security_test.ts:INVARIANT: Total escrowed amount equals sum of funded invoices`
- **Verification:** Check that release/refund operations correctly decrease escrowed amounts
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

### INV-2: Authorization Integrity
**Statement:** `Only (payer OR arbiter) can release/refund FUNDED invoices`
- **Test:** `tests/escrow_security_test.ts:SECURITY: Unauthorized release attempt`
- **Verification:** Verify `ERR-NOT-ARBITER-OR-PAYER` enforced
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

### INV-3: State Machine Correctness
**Statement:** `Invoice state transitions: OPEN → FUNDED → (RELEASED | REFUNDED)`
- **Test:** `tests/escrow_security_test.ts:SECURITY: Cannot release from OPEN state`
- **Verification:** Confirm no invalid state transitions possible
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

### INV-4: No Double-Spend
**Statement:** `Each invoice can be released/refunded exactly once`
- **Test:** `tests/escrow_security_test.ts:SECURITY: Double-release attempt should fail`
- **Verification:** Status changes prevent repeated operations
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

### INV-5: Token Whitelist Enforcement
**Statement:** `Only whitelisted token contracts accepted in invoices`
- **Contract:** `escrow-secure.clar:check-token-whitelisted`
- **Verification:** Attempts with non-whitelisted tokens fail
- **Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

## 🚨 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Implementation Limitations
1. **Single Arbiter Model**
   - Risk: Arbiter key compromise allows unauthorized releases
   - Mitigation: Use DAO multisig as arbiter
   - Future: Implement multi-arbiter voting

2. **Two-Step Deposit Flow**
   - Risk: Race condition window between transfer and ack-deposit
   - Mitigation: UI enforces wallet post-conditions
   - Future: Atomic deposit operation

3. **No Timelock Mechanisms**
   - Risk: Funds could be locked indefinitely if dispute unresolved
   - Mitigation: Arbiter SLA requirements
   - Future: Auto-resolution after timeout

4. **Mock Token in Tests**
   - Risk: Production sBTC behavior may differ
   - Mitigation: **MUST** test with real sBTC before mainnet
   - Status: ⚠️ IN PROGRESS
