## üé§ Presentation Script

### 1. Problem Statement (30 seconds)
"Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness, affecting millions worldwide. Early detection can prevent vision loss, but many people lack access to specialized eye screenings, especially in underserved areas."

### 2. Solution Overview (30 seconds)
"RetinaScan AI is an accessible, AI-powered screening tool that analyzes retinal images in seconds. It can be used by primary care physicians, community health workers, or even patients themselves with a smartphone."

### 3. AI Technology (60 seconds)
"Our AI uses **EfficientNet**, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture, trained on thousands of retinal images. But what makes it special are three key features:

1. **Explainable AI with Grad-CAM**: Unlike black-box AI, we show exactly what the model sees. [Show visualization] These red areas are microaneurysms and hemorrhages that indicate diabetic retinopathy.

2. **Uncertainty Estimation**: The AI knows when it's uncertain and flags cases for specialist review. This makes it safe for real-world deployment.

3. **Advanced Preprocessing**: We use the Ben Graham method, a winner technique from Kaggle competitions, to handle varying image qualities."

### 4. Live Demo (60 seconds)
[Upload image]
"Let's analyze this retinal image. [Wait for result]

- **Diagnosis**: Moderate Diabetic Retinopathy
- **Confidence**: 87%
- **Uncertainty**: Low (5%)
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Recommendation**: Immediate referral to retinal specialist within 3-6 months

And here's the Grad-CAM visualization showing the lesions the AI detected. [Point to red areas]"

### 5. Impact (30 seconds)
"This tool can screen thousands of patients daily, reducing specialist workload and catching cases early. It's especially impactful in rural and underserved areas where ophthalmologists are scarce. We estimate it could prevent blindness in thousands of people annually."

### 6. Technical Excellence (30 seconds)
"From a technical standpoint, we've implemented:
- Focal loss for class imbalance
- Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty
- Two-stage training with fine-tuning
- Advanced data augmentation
- Risk stratification for clinical workflows

This isn't just a prototype‚Äîit's production-ready AI."
